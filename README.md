📂 File Structure
FILE.cpp — Main source file containing all classes and logic

README.md — Project overview and usage instructions (this file)

📝 Notes
The system uses in-memory storage (via vector<Tour>), so data is not persistent between runs.

This is a basic prototype suitable for learning and educational purposes.

📌 Future Enhancements
Integrate file I/O or a database for persistent storage

Add validation for age, phone number, and booking input

Implement seat availability checks when booking

Improve UI with colors or a GUI framework (e.g., Qt or NCurses)
